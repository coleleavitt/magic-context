/**
 * Reaching the OpenCode 2 host's own HTTP API from inside a plugin.
 *
 * The plugin surface a v2 host hands us carries no client and no address, but a host running in
 * service mode registers itself in a file that is the whole discovery contract: a base URL, the
 * password for basic auth, and the process id of the host that wrote it. Everything here is plain
 * `fetch` and `node:fs` on purpose — the OpenCode client package stays a development dependency and
 * must not be imported at runtime.
 *
 * Registrations are channel-scoped, and a channel is also what picks the host's session database,
 * so two registrations on one machine can belong to two completely separate stores. Discovery
 * therefore never picks "whichever registration exists": it picks the registration written by THIS
 * process, matched on process id, which is the one host whose store contains the sessions this
 * plugin instance created. A plain `opencode serve` and a `--standalone` host write no registration
 * at all, so discovery legitimately comes up empty; every caller treats that as "not now" rather
 * than an error.
 *
 * Bytes this follows, identical in `@opencode/cli` 2.0.5 and 2.0.11:
 *   - filename: `service.json` on the `latest`/`dev`/`beta`/`next` channels, otherwise
 *     `service-<channel>.json` with everything outside `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` replaced by `-`;
 *   - directory: `$XDG_STATE_HOME/opencode` (`~/.local/state/opencode` with no XDG override);
 *   - contents: `{ id, version, url, pid, password }`, where `pid` is the serving process's own
 *     `process.pid` and `id` is that service's identifier. The host re-reads this file and shuts
 *     itself down when the id/pid/url/password it observes are no longer its own, so a live
 *     registration always describes the process that currently owns the endpoint.
